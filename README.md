The Jupyter Notebooks:

`training_features.ipynb`\
`training_features_UniMiB.ipynb`\
`training_raw.ipynb`\
`training_raw_UniMiB.ipynb`

contain the training and the results of classification with the tested ML algorithms.

The notebooks ending with `UniMiB` use the `UniMiB_SHAR` dataset, the other the `UniZgFall` dataset.

The notebooks `raw` contain the training on raw accelerometer data, while the `features` ones do the training with the 94 extracted features.
